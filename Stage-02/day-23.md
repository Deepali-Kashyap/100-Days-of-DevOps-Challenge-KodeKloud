## Day 23: Fork a Git Repository

**Challenge:** Use GitHub’s graphical interface to **fork** an existing repository from one user account to another, enabling independent development and contribution through pull requests.

---

### Steps Followed

1. Login to GitHub  
   - Open your GitHub account in the browser.

2. Locate the Repository to Fork  
   - Navigate to the repository you want to fork.  
   - Example: `https://github.com/original-user/project-name`

3. Fork the Repository  
   - Click on the **Fork** button (top-right corner of the repo page).  
   - Select your GitHub account as the destination for the fork.

4. Verify the Fork  
   - Once complete, you’ll be redirected to:  
     `https://github.com/your-username/project-name`  
   - The repository now exists in your own account.  
   - You can clone, modify, or open pull requests to contribute back to the original repository.

### Outcome
- Repository successfully forked from one user account to another via GitHub GUI.  
- Verified that the forked repository is now owned by the new user.  
- Ready for further development or collaboration through branches and pull requests.  
### Key Learnings
- Understanding the concept and purpose of **forking** in Git.  
- Using GitHub’s **web interface** for repository management.  
- Preparing for open-source collaboration workflows.  
- Difference between **cloning** (local copy) and **forking** (new remote copy under your account).
