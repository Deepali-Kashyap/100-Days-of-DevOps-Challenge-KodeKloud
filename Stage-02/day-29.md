## Day 29: Manage Git Pull Requests

**Challenge:** Create and manage a GitHub pull request (PR) using the graphical interface. Assign a reviewer, get approval, and merge the branch into the master branch.

---

## Steps Followed

1. **Login to GitHub**  
   - Open your GitHub account in a web browser.

2. **Create a New Pull Request**  
   - Navigate to your repository (e.g., `apps` or similar).  
   - Click on the **Pull requests** tab → **New pull request**.  
   - Select the feature or development branch as the **compare** branch and **master** as the **base** branch.  
   - Add a title and description for the PR.  
   - Example title:  
     ```
     Add new updates to web configuration
     ```

3. **Assign a Reviewer**  
   - Add **Tom** as the reviewer for the pull request.  
   - This allows Tom to review the code and approve before merging.

4. **Review and Approval**  
   - Tom reviews the pull request via the GitHub interface.  
   - After confirming that the changes look good, Tom clicks **Approve** and submits the review.

5. **Merge the Pull Request**  
   - Once approved, the PR is merged into the **master** branch using the **Merge pull request** button.  
   - Optionally, delete the source branch after merging to keep the repo clean.
