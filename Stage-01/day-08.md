# Day 08 â€“ Install Ansible with pip

## Step 1: Install Python pip
```bash
sudo yum install python3-pip -y
```
- Installs `pip3`, the Python package manager, required to install Ansible via pip.

---

## Step 2: Install Ansible 4.9.0 using pip
```bash
sudo pip3 install ansible==4.9.0
```
- Installs a specific version of Ansible (4.9.0) globally.
- Using `sudo` ensures the installation is available system-wide, not just for a single user.

---

## Step 3: Verify Installation
```bash
which ansible
```
- Displays the binary path of Ansible.
- Example output:
```
/usr/local/bin/ansible
```
This confirms Ansible is installed globally and available for all users.

---

## Step 4: Why Install via pip?
- Provides flexibility to install specific versions (e.g., `4.9.0`).
- Easier and faster updates compared to OS package manager.
- Widely used in Python-based automation environments.

---

## Real-World Relevance
- Ansible is a powerful automation and configuration management tool.
- Installing via pip ensures teams can match exact versions across environments.
- Critical for consistency in DevOps pipelines and when reproducing issues across environments.
