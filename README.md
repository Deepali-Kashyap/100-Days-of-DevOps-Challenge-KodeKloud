# 100-Days-of-DevOps-Challenge-KodeKloud
This repository is part of my personal journey to complete the **100 Days of DevOps Challenge (KodeKloud Inspired)**.  

Every day, I tackle a new DevOps-related task and document my learnings here — from Linux administration, Git, and automation, to Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD pipelines, Infrastructure as Code, and Cloud technologies.  

📅 Goal: Stay consistent for 100 days and build a strong DevOps portfolio.  
📌 Motto: Learn by doing, document everything, and share knowledge.  

## 🧩 Stage 1: Linux & Server Administration (Days 1 – 20)

Stage 1 focused on mastering essential Linux and server administration skills — setting up users, securing SSH access, managing permissions, configuring services, and deploying basic web stacks.

### ✅ Completed Tasks

* Linux user setup, temporary users, and SSH hardening
* File permissions, SELinux, cron jobs, and authentication
* Installation and configuration of Ansible, MariaDB, Tomcat, Nginx, PostgreSQL, and LAMP stack
* Network services, IPTables, and SSL setup for Nginx
