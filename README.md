# 🚀 100 Days of DevOps Challenge (KodeKloud Inspired)

This repository documents my personal journey to complete the **100 Days of DevOps Challenge (KodeKloud Inspired)**.

Each day, I explore a new DevOps concept — from **Linux administration and Git**, to **Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, Ansible, Terraform, and Cloud (AWS)**.

📅 **Goal:** Stay consistent for 100 days and build a strong DevOps portfolio.
📌 **Motto:** *Learn by doing, document everything, and share knowledge.*

---

## 🧩 Stage 1: Linux & Server Administration (Days 1 – 20)

Stage 1 focused on mastering essential Linux and server administration skills — setting up users, securing SSH access, managing permissions, configuring services, and deploying basic web stacks.

### ✅ Completed Tasks

* Linux user setup, temporary users, and SSH hardening
* File permissions, SELinux, cron jobs, and authentication
* Installation and configuration of Ansible, MariaDB, Tomcat, Nginx, PostgreSQL, and LAMP stack
* Network services, IPTables, and SSL setup for Nginx

---

## ⚙️ Stage 2: Version Control & Containerization (Days 21 – 47)

Stage 2 focused on mastering Git workflows and Docker fundamentals — from repository management and branching strategies to building, networking, and deploying containers.

### ✅ Completed Tasks

* Git setup, repository management, branching, merging, and pull requests
* Advanced Git operations: revert, cherry-pick, rebase, hooks, and conflict resolution
* Docker installation, image management, and container operations
* Writing Dockerfiles, configuring networks, mapping ports, and using Docker Compose
* Deploying web and Python applications inside containers

---

## ☸️ Stage 3: Kubernetes & Container Orchestration (Days 48 – 67)

Stage 3 focuses on container orchestration with Kubernetes — deploying applications, managing pods and volumes, handling updates, and ensuring scalability and reliability across clusters.

### 🛠️ Working On

* Deploy Pods and Applications using Kubernetes Deployments
* Set resource limits, perform rolling updates, and revert versions
* Manage VolumeMounts, shared volumes, sidecar containers, and persistent storage
* Deploy and troubleshoot web, Python, Redis, MySQL, and multi-tier apps on Kubernetes
* Implement init containers, secrets, and environment variables
* Deploy monitoring tools like Grafana within Kubernetes clusters

---

## 🔁 Stage 4: Continuous Integration & Deployment with Jenkins (Days 68 – 81)

Stage 4 focuses on mastering Jenkins for automation — from setup and access management to building advanced pipelines and deployment jobs.

### 🛠️ Work in Progress

* Set up Jenkins server and install essential plugins
* Configure user access, parameterized builds, and scheduled jobs
* Create database backup and package installation jobs
* Configure Jenkins slave nodes and project security
* Build deploy, conditional, and chained pipelines
* Implement multistage CI/CD pipelines integrating Git and Docker

---

## ☁️ Stage 5: Configuration Management, Cloud & Infrastructure as Code (Days 82 – 100)

Stage 5 focuses on mastering **Ansible** for configuration management and **Terraform** for automating cloud infrastructure — bringing together DevOps automation and **Cloud (AWS)** provisioning to achieve full Infrastructure as Code (IaC) workflows.

### 🛠️ Work in Progress

* Create Ansible inventory and playbooks for app server testing
* Copy data, manage files, packages, ACLs, and services using Ansible modules
* Use advanced Ansible features like Jinja2 templates, conditionals, and lineinfile/blockinfile modules
* Build and manage AWS infrastructure using Terraform — VPCs, security groups, EC2 instances, and IAM policies
* Configure CloudWatch alarms and integrate Terraform workflows for cloud-based automation and monitoring

---

### 🏁 Final Goal

By the end of this challenge, I aim to have hands-on expertise across the full DevOps lifecycle — from **Linux and automation** to **CI/CD, cloud, and infrastructure as code**, demonstrating end-to-end modern DevOps proficiency.
